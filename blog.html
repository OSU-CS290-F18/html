	<h4>Challenges & Troubles</h4>
	<p>I spent half of a day to finish this assignment.
	   I think the most challenging part for me is to make servals div display in one row and can resize as the change of browser size. I didnâ€™t know how to realize it in the beginning, so I looked for help in the  internet, after reading some examples, I find a solution.
           I learn a lot of concept in CSS, like padding margin, absolute position and relative position. It is convenient to change the style of element with simple code. CSS is extremely important for web developing. Also there are servals kind of selector to us, very convenient.
           I found W3school is a useful website to use, you can basically find everything you needed.
